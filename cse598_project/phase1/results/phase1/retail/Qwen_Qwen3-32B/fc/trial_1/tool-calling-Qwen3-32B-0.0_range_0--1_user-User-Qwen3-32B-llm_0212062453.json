        "content": "# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users cancel or modify pending orders, return or exchange delivered orders, modify their default user address, or provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products.\n\n- At the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\n- Once the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\n- You can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\n- Before taking consequential actions that update the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you have to list the action detail and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided from the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n- Each user has a profile of its email, default address, user id, and payment methods. Each payment method is either a gift card, a paypal account, or a credit card.\n\n- Our retail store has 50 types of products. For each type of product, there are variant items of different options. For example, for a 't shirt' product, there could be an item with option 'color blue size M', and another item with option 'color red size L'.\n\n- Each product has an unique product id, and each item has an unique item id. They have no relations and should not be confused.\n\n- Each order can be in status 'pending', 'processed', 'delivered', or 'cancelled'. Generally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\n- Exchange or modify order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\n- An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\n- An order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- For a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\n- The user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\n- If the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be kept 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\n- This action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)', and the agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So confirm all the details are right and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be modified.\n\n- For a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\n- An order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id, the list of items to be returned, and a payment method to receive the refund.\n\n- The refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\n- An order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\n- For a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n"

She's emotional and stressed, and she likes to talk a lot.\n\nThe agent started with \"Hi! How can I help you today?\" So I need to respond as Amelia. She needs to explain her situation step by step. First, she might mention the financial problem. Then she'll want to cancel or return orders. But she doesn't have the order IDs, so she'll have to say that. She'll provide her emails and location. The key is to make the conversation natural, one line at a time, without giving all info upfront.\n\nFirst response: She should express her problem, maybe start with \"I\u2019m really stressed and need help...\" Then mention the financial issue, wanting to cancel/return orders. Next, when asked for order IDs, she says she doesn't remember. Then provide her emails and location. If the agent asks for more info not given, she can't provide it. The goal is to get the cancellation/return processed. Once the agent helps, she'll say thanks and then ###STOP###.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019m really stressed and need help right away\u2014I just went through a financial emergency and want to cancel or return all my pending orders to get some relief."

Amelia is a loyal customer from Philadelphia who wants to cancel or return all possible orders due to a financial issue. She mentioned she's emotional and stressed, and she likes to talk a lot. The agent's first response was a greeting, so I need to respond as Amelia, providing her problem step by step.\n\nFirst, she needs to authenticate her identity. The user provided her email and zip code. The agent should use the find_user_id_by_email function to locate her user ID. If that's not possible, then use find_user_id_by_name_zip with her name and zip code. Once authenticated, the agent can check her orders using get_user_details or get_order_details.\n\nAmelia doesn't have the order IDs, so the agent needs to retrieve them. The agent should list all pending and delivered orders. For pending orders, cancellation or modification is possible. For delivered orders, returns or exchanges are options. The user wants to cancel or return all possible orders, so the agent should check each order's status.\n\nFor each pending order, the agent should confirm cancellation with the user, specifying the reason. For delivered orders, the user needs to confirm which items to return or exchange. The agent must ensure that refunds are processed correctly, using the original payment method or a gift card.\n\nSince Amelia is stressed, the agent should handle each request step by step, asking for confirmation at each stage. The user might not have all the necessary details, so the agent should prompt for missing information, like order IDs or payment method IDs, using the appropriate functions to retrieve them.\n\nThe agent must also be cautious about modifying or canceling orders, ensuring that all actions are confirmed by the user. If there's any ambiguity, transferring to a human agent might be necessary, but the user hasn't explicitly asked for that yet. The key is to proceed methodically, providing clear options and requiring explicit confirmations to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\n",

        "content": "# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users cancel or modify pending orders, return or exchange delivered orders, modify their default user address, or provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products.\n\n- At the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\n- Once the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\n- You can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\n- Before taking consequential actions that update the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you have to list the action detail and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided from the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n- Each user has a profile of its email, default address, user id, and payment methods. Each payment method is either a gift card, a paypal account, or a credit card.\n\n- Our retail store has 50 types of products. For each type of product, there are variant items of different options. For example, for a 't shirt' product, there could be an item with option 'color blue size M', and another item with option 'color red size L'.\n\n- Each product has an unique product id, and each item has an unique item id. They have no relations and should not be confused.\n\n- Each order can be in status 'pending', 'processed', 'delivered', or 'cancelled'. Generally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\n- Exchange or modify order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\n- An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\n- An order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- For a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\n- The user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\n- If the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be kept 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\n- This action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)', and the agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So confirm all the details are right and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be modified.\n\n- For a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\n- An order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id, the list of items to be returned, and a payment method to receive the refund.\n\n- The refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\n- An order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\n- For a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

So perhaps in the first message, just talk about the jacket. Then, if the agent asks for order ID, she says she doesn't have it. Then proceed to the skateboard modification. Then the grills. Each step in separate messages. That way, it's natural and follows the rules.\n</think>\n\nHi, I need to remove a fleece jacket that was mistakenly added to my order. If I can\u2019t remove just that item, I\u2019ll have to cancel the entire order. Can you help with that?",

If that's not possible, she'll cancel the whole order. Also, she wants to modify the skateboard to maple material, 34 inch, graphic. If that's not available, cancel the order. Plus, she wants to know the total prices for the grills she's paid for.\n\nThe agent just responded to her first message about the fleece jacket. Now I need to figure out her next step. The rules say to generate one line at a time, not give all info at once. So after the agent's response, she might need to provide more details. But the user's next message should address the next part of the instruction.\n\nWait, the user's first message was about the fleece jacket. The agent's response is \"Hi! How can I help you today?\" and the user replied with the jacket issue. Now the agent's next message is \"Of course! Could you provide your order number so I can check the details?\" The user needs to respond. Since the instruction doesn't mention an order number, the user should say she doesn't have it. Then, the agent might ask for the zip code or other info. The user's zip is 94128, so maybe she can provide that. But the main goal is to remove the jacket or cancel. If the agent can't proceed without the order number, the user might have to cancel. Then, the next step would be to mention the skateboard modification. But the user needs to do one step at a time. Also, the grills payment total is another part. So after handling the jacket and skateboard, she needs to ask about the grills. Once all are addressed, end with ###STOP###. Need to make sure each step is natural and follows the rules.\n</think>\n\nI don\u2019t have the order number handy, but my zip code is 94128. Is there another way to locate my order?"

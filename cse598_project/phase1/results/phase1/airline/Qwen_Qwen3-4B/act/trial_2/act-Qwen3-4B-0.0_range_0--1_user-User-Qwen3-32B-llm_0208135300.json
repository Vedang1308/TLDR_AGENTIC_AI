        "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"book_reservation\", \"description\": \"Book a reservation.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The ID of the user to book the reservation, such as 'sara_doe_496'.\"}, \"origin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the origin city, such as 'SFO'.\"}, \"destination\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the destination city, such as 'JFK'.\"}, \"flight_type\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"one_way\", \"round_trip\"]}, \"cabin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"basic_economy\", \"economy\", \"business\"]}, \"flights\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each piece of flight.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"flight_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Flight number, such as 'HAT001'.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date for the flight in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '2024-05-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"flight_number\", \"date\"]}}, \"passengers\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each passenger.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"first_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The first name of the passenger, such as 'Noah'.\"}, \"last_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The last name of the passenger, such as 'Brown'.\"}, \"dob\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date of birth of the passenger in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '1990-01-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"dob\"]}}, \"payment_methods\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each payment method.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"payment_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The payment id stored in user profile, such as 'credit_card_7815826', 'gift_card_7815826', 'certificate_7815826'.\"}, \"amount\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"The amount to be paid.\"}}, \"required\": [\"payment_id\", \"amount\"]}}, \"total_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The total number of baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"nonfree_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The number of non-free baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"insurance\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"yes\", \"no\"]}}, \"required\": [\"user_id\", \"origin\", \"destination\", \"flight_type\", \"cabin\", \"flights\", \"passengers\", \"payment_methods\", \"total_baggages\", \"nonfree_baggages\", \"insurance\"]}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding what the user needs. They have a reservation ID 1N99U6 for a flight from LAS to IAH that's currently a one-stop. They want to change it to a nonstop flight. Also, they want to remove their checked bag and get a refund for it.\n\nFirst, the user's initial message is asking how they can help today. I need to respond by stating the main issue: changing the flight and removing the checked bag. I should mention the reservation ID right away to help the agent locate their booking quickly. I'll also mention the refund for the checked bag, but maybe not go into too much detail yet unless the agent asks. Let me phrase it naturally without repeating the exact instruction. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says not to give all the info at once. So maybe just mention the flight change first and then the bag refund. But since the agent might need the reservation ID upfront, I should include that. Let me check the rules again: don't hallucinate info not provided. The reservation ID is given, so that's safe. \n\nSo the response should be concise, mention changing the flight to nonstop, provide the reservation ID, and note the checked bag refund request. Keep it one line as per the rules. Let me draft that.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019d like to change my upcoming flight from LAS to IAH to a nonstop option and remove my checked bag for a refund. My reservation ID is 1N99U6."
      },
      {
        "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to change their flight from LAS to IAH to a nonstop one and remove their checked bag for a refund. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the reservation ID is 1N99U6. The original flight is a one-stop, so they need to find a nonstop alternative. According to the policy, modifying flights requires the user ID and reservation ID. But the user hasn't provided their user ID yet. Wait, the initial message didn't include it. Hmm, maybe I need to ask for the user ID first? But the user might not have mentioned it. Let me check the tools available.\n\nThe modify flight function requires the reservation ID and user ID. Since the user provided the reservation ID but not the user ID, I need to prompt them for it. But the user's message doesn't include the user ID. Wait, the initial instruction says that the agent must first obtain the user id and reservation id for modifying. So I need to ask the user for their user ID. But in the current message, the user hasn't provided it. So maybe I should ask for the user ID first before proceeding with the flight change.\n\nAdditionally, the user wants to remove a checked bag. The policy says that users can't remove checked bags, only add. So removing a bag isn't possible. The agent should inform the user that they can't remove bags but can adjust the number of bags if needed. However, the user is asking for a refund, which might be related to the checked bag. But according to the policy, the refund for bags would depend on the cancellation rules. Wait, the user is trying to remove the bag, which isn't allowed, so the agent should explain that they can't remove bags but can adjust the number if they want to add more. However, the user is asking for a refund, which might be a misunderstanding. The refund for bags would only be possible if they cancel the reservation, but the user is trying to remove the bag, which isn't allowed. So the agent needs to clarify that they can't remove bags and that the refund would require cancellation.\n\nSo the steps are: 1. Ask for the user ID to proceed with modifying the flight. 2. Inform the user that removing a checked bag isn't possible, but they can adjust the number of bags if they want to add more. 3. Check if they want to proceed with the flight change and adjust the bags. But since the user is asking to remove the bag, the agent should explain that it's not allowed and maybe offer to adjust the number of bags if they want to add more. However, the user might be confused about the refund. The refund for the bag would only be possible if they cancel the reservation, but the user is trying to remove the bag, which isn't allowed. So the agent needs to clarify that they can't remove bags and that the refund would require cancellation.\n\nWait, the user's message says \"remove my checked bag and get a refund for it.\" But according to the policy, you can't remove bags. So the agent should explain that they can't remove bags but can adjust the number of bags if needed. However, the user is asking for a refund, which might be a misunderstanding. The refund for bags would only be possible if they cancel the reservation, but the user is trying to remove the bag, which isn't allowed. So the agent needs to clarify that they can't remove bags and that the refund would require cancellation.\n\nSo the agent should first ask for the user ID to proceed with the flight modification. Then, explain that removing a checked bag isn't possible, but they can adjust the number of bags if they want to add more. However, the user is asking for a refund, which might be a misunderstanding. The agent should inform them that the refund for the bag would require cancellation, which is a separate process. But the user is trying to remove the bag, which isn't allowed. So the agent needs to clarify that they can't remove bags and that the refund would require cancellation.\n\nTherefore, the agent should first ask for the user ID, then explain the bag removal issue and the refund process.

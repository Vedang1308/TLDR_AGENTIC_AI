        "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"book_reservation\", \"description\": \"Book a reservation.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The ID of the user to book the reservation, such as 'sara_doe_496'.\"}, \"origin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the origin city, such as 'SFO'.\"}, \"destination\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the destination city, such as 'JFK'.\"}, \"flight_type\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"one_way\", \"round_trip\"]}, \"cabin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"basic_economy\", \"economy\", \"business\"]}, \"flights\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each piece of flight.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"flight_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Flight number, such as 'HAT001'.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date for the flight in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '2024-05-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"flight_number\", \"date\"]}}, \"passengers\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each passenger.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"first_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The first name of the passenger, such as 'Noah'.\"}, \"last_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The last name of the passenger, such as 'Brown'.\"}, \"dob\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date of birth of the passenger in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '1990-01-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"dob\"]}}, \"payment_methods\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each payment method.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"payment_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The payment id stored in user profile, such as 'credit_card_7815826', 'gift_card_7815826', 'certificate_7815826'.\"}, \"amount\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"The amount to be paid.\"}}, \"required\": [\"payment_id\", \"amount\"]}}, \"total_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The total number of baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"nonfree_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The number of non-free baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"insurance\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"yes\", \"no\"]}}, \"required\": [\"user_id\", \"origin\", \"destination\", \"flight_type\", \"cabin\", \"flights\", \"passengers\", \"payment_methods\", \"total_baggages\", \"nonfree_baggages\", \"insurance\"]}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

The cabin is basic economy, and she didn't have insurance. The reservation was created on May 7th, and today is May 15th. So, it's been 8 days since the booking. The policy says that cancellations within 24 hours are allowed, but after that, basic economy flights can only be cancelled if the user has travel insurance or if the airline cancelled the flight. Since she doesn't have insurance and the airline didn't cancel the flight, she might not be eligible for a refund. But she mentioned she was out of town and couldn't confirm earlier. However, the policy is strict, so even if she was out of town, the 24-hour window has passed. The flights are scheduled for May 15th and 18th. The first flight is today, May 15th, which is already departing. The cancellation policy states that the agent can only cancel the whole trip if none of the segments have been used. But since the first flight is today and the current time is 15:00 EST, the flight might have already departed or is about to depart. Checking the flight status: the first flight is HAT043 from EWR to CLT on May 15th. The status isn't mentioned, but the current time is 15:00, which is when the flight is scheduled. If the flight hasn't departed yet, maybe there's a chance to cancel, but according to the policy, after 24 hours, basic economy can't be cancelled unless insured. Since she doesn't have insurance, the cancellation isn't allowed. The user might need to be informed that she can't cancel and perhaps offered a certificate if she's a member or has insurance, but she's a regular member without insurance. So, the answer should explain that cancellation isn't possible and suggest contacting a human agent if she needs further help.\n</think>\n\nThought: The reservation was created 8 days ago (May 7) and the first flight is today (May 15).

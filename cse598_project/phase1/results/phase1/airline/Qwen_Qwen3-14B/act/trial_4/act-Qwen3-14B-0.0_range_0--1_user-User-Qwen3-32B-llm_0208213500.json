        "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"book_reservation\", \"description\": \"Book a reservation.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The ID of the user to book the reservation, such as 'sara_doe_496'.\"}, \"origin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the origin city, such as 'SFO'.\"}, \"destination\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the destination city, such as 'JFK'.\"}, \"flight_type\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"one_way\", \"round_trip\"]}, \"cabin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"basic_economy\", \"economy\", \"business\"]}, \"flights\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each piece of flight.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"flight_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Flight number, such as 'HAT001'.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date for the flight in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '2024-05-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"flight_number\", \"date\"]}}, \"passengers\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each passenger.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"first_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The first name of the passenger, such as 'Noah'.\"}, \"last_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The last name of the passenger, such as 'Brown'.\"}, \"dob\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date of birth of the passenger in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '1990-01-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"dob\"]}}, \"payment_methods\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each payment method.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"payment_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The payment id stored in user profile, such as 'credit_card_7815826', 'gift_card_7815826', 'certificate_7815826'.\"}, \"amount\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"The amount to be paid.\"}}, \"required\": [\"payment_id\", \"amount\"]}}, \"total_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The total number of baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"nonfree_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The number of non-free baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"insurance\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"yes\", \"no\"]}}, \"required\": [\"user_id\", \"origin\", \"destination\", \"flight_type\", \"cabin\", \"flights\", \"passengers\", \"payment_methods\", \"total_baggages\", \"nonfree_baggages\", \"insurance\"]}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

Since she mentioned not remembering the reservation ID, I should ask her to confirm her user ID or check her email for the reservation details. But according to the policy, I can't look up her reservation without the ID. Also, the rules say that Basic Economy flights can't be modified. So I need to check what type of reservation she has.\n\nWait, the user mentioned she's willing to cancel with insurance if needed. So maybe the first step is to get her reservation ID. But she doesn't remember it. Hmm. The policy says that to modify a flight, the agent must first obtain the user ID and reservation ID. Since she doesn't have the reservation ID, I can't proceed with the modification. Also, if her reservation is Basic Economy, it can't be modified at all. So I need to inform her that without the reservation ID, I can't proceed, and check if her reservation is eligible for modification. Alternatively, if she can't provide the reservation ID, I might need to transfer her to a human agent. But the policy says to transfer only if the request can't be handled. So maybe I should ask her to provide the reservation ID first. Let me check the available tools. The get_user_details function requires a user ID, which she might not have. Wait, the user's name is Olivia Gonzalez, but the user ID is different. So I need to ask her for her user ID or reservation ID. Since she doesn't remember the reservation ID, maybe I can't proceed. Alternatively, if she's a member, maybe I can look up her reservations with her email. But the tools don't have a function to search by email. The get_user_details function requires a user ID. So without that, I can't proceed. Therefore, I need to ask her for her user ID or reservation ID. But she might not know. So the agent should ask for the reservation ID first. If she can't provide it, then the agent can't proceed and might need to transfer her. But according to the policy, the agent should not transfer unless the request can't be handled. So the next step is to ask for the reservation ID.

        "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"book_reservation\", \"description\": \"Book a reservation.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The ID of the user to book the reservation, such as 'sara_doe_496'.\"}, \"origin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the origin city, such as 'SFO'.\"}, \"destination\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the destination city, such as 'JFK'.\"}, \"flight_type\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"one_way\", \"round_trip\"]}, \"cabin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"basic_economy\", \"economy\", \"business\"]}, \"flights\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each piece of flight.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"flight_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Flight number, such as 'HAT001'.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date for the flight in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '2024-05-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"flight_number\", \"date\"]}}, \"passengers\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each passenger.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"first_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The first name of the passenger, such as 'Noah'.\"}, \"last_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The last name of the passenger, such as 'Brown'.\"}, \"dob\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date of birth of the passenger in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '1990-01-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"dob\"]}}, \"payment_methods\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each payment method.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"payment_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The payment id stored in user profile, such as 'credit_card_7815826', 'gift_card_7815826', 'certificate_7815826'.\"}, \"amount\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"The amount to be paid.\"}}, \"required\": [\"payment_id\", \"amount\"]}}, \"total_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The total number of baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"nonfree_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The number of non-free baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"insurance\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"yes\", \"no\"]}}, \"required\": [\"user_id\", \"origin\", \"destination\", \"flight_type\", \"cabin\", \"flights\", \"passengers\", \"payment_methods\", \"total_baggages\", \"nonfree_baggages\", \"insurance\"]}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

However, according to the rules, the user shouldn't make up info they don't have. \n\nThe user's initial message is a greeting, so the agent's response should prompt them to explain their request. The user needs to convey their request in a natural way, mentioning downgrading flights, refunding to original payment, and wanting to know the total savings. They should avoid giving all the instructions at once. \n\nI need to make sure each message from the user is one line, progresses the conversation, and follows the rules.

        "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status.

If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n#Available tools\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"book_reservation\", \"description\": \"Book a reservation.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The ID of the user to book the reservation, such as 'sara_doe_496'.\"}, \"origin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the origin city, such as 'SFO'.\"}, \"destination\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The IATA code for the destination city, such as 'JFK'.\"}, \"flight_type\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"one_way\", \"round_trip\"]}, \"cabin\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"basic_economy\", \"economy\", \"business\"]}, \"flights\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each piece of flight.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"flight_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Flight number, such as 'HAT001'.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date for the flight in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '2024-05-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"flight_number\", \"date\"]}}, \"passengers\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each passenger.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"first_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The first name of the passenger, such as 'Noah'.\"}, \"last_name\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The last name of the passenger, such as 'Brown'.\"}, \"dob\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date of birth of the passenger in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', such as '1990-01-01'.\"}}, \"required\": [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"dob\"]}}, \"payment_methods\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"An array of objects containing details about each payment method.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"payment_id\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The payment id stored in user profile, such as 'credit_card_7815826', 'gift_card_7815826', 'certificate_7815826'.\"}, \"amount\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"The amount to be paid.\"}}, \"required\": [\"payment_id\", \"amount\"]}}, \"total_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The total number of baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"nonfree_baggages\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The number of non-free baggage items included in the reservation.\"}, \"insurance\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"yes\", \"no\"]}}, \"required\": [\"user_id\", \"origin\", \"destination\", \"flight_type\", \"cabin\", \"flights\", \"passengers\", \"payment_methods\", \"total_baggages\", \"nonfree_baggages\", \"insurance\"]}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

They don't want to provide their birthday again since it's already in their profile.\n\nI should ask for the order ID first because that's usually needed to make changes.

So when the agent asks for it, the user might say they don't remember. Let me check the rules again to make sure I'm following correctly.\n\nNext, the user wants to change the passenger name to themselves. I need to prompt them to confirm that. Then, the class upgrade from economy to business? Wait, no, the instruction says upgrade to economy class. Wait, maybe they're currently in a different class and want to upgrade to economy? That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, but I should stick to the instruction as given. So upgrade to economy class, add three checked bags, and use gift card payment.\n\nPayment method is gift card, so I need to ask if they have the gift card details ready. Also, they don't want to provide their birthday again, so if the agent asks, they can mention it's already in their profile.\n\nLet me outline the steps: start by confirming the order ID, then passenger change, class upgrade, checked bags, payment method, and confirm birthday is already on file.
